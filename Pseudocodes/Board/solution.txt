Returns the solution set from given from a given game.

Make sure to memorize past behaviour for efficiency, and use them at the start of the function definition.


1. Check if the input is memorized. Continue iff it isn't. Else, return true.

2. Determine the next possible inputs and the solutions from them given the current board. Add them to the current set of solutions if there's anything new. If not, continue with a different input. repeat over all inputs. 
(Make sure to not have repeats, for efficiency.)

3. Return the solution set.
