Goal: Create a random game.


0. Initialize variables.
	- A <map> variable mapping all the remaining [rows] to all the remaining [cells] in them.
	- A <map> variable with each number as keys and app positions used for it.
	- 

1. Create random position for each number remaining.
	.1. Pick a random remaining [row]. 
	.2. Then a random remaining [cell] from given row.

2. Remove a random set of numbers while making sure the solution remains the same. (Create a solution function for the board here.)
